# dialog_with_data
A draft and proof of concept for making discussions more data-driven. This project enables participants to share and explore arguments grounded in data, modify core data points, and assess varying viewpoints in a transparent and respectful manner. Inspired by the principles of nonviolent communication, it aims to foster deeper understanding and empathy in discourse by:

    Facilitating the sharing of data-rich discussions

    Enabling interactive modification of underlying datasets

    Supporting the evaluation of diverse perspectives through structured dialogue

This is an early conceptual implementationâ€”feedback, contributions, and critiques are welcome.
